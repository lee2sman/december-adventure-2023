<h1 class="title">December Adventure</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="dec-1">Dec 1</h2>
<p>Okay, I’m starting the <a
href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">December Adventure</a> but
worried my first project is too much slog and not enough adventure. I
need to rebuild my website! So this means I’ll need to make it more fun
for myself: an actual adventure.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to get the motivation to rebuild it many times previously.
It mostly looked like the same homepage for the past 6 years. Then a
couple months ago I changed my landing page to a HTML only page with
dithered image. Nerdy, yes, but is this actually a good landing page for
an artist? Anyway, the whole site is a hodgepodge now, and all of my
projects that I crank out are not in the portfolio or linked from the
gallery page. This needs must change!</p>
<p>Starting out, here are my goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t reinvent the wheel. If someone has built better, and is
sharing their code, then it’s fine to re-use and share as well</li>
<li>yes, brutalist, but readable</li>
<li>do your best to keep semantic HTML and accessibility ideas in
mind</li>
<li>can you make things lower bandwidth?</li>
<li>make things flexible and fun so the site can grow and adapt to my
idiosyncratic and changing projects and ways of working and grow over
time</li>
<li>Capture the spirit of my previous work with my webpage, e.g. <a
href="https://leetusman.com/studio-visit/">Studio visit</a>, <a
href="https://leetusman.com/404">404</a>, <a
href="https://leetusman.com/everyday">everyday</a> etc</li>
</ul>
<p>My three spirit websites for this are <a
href="https://elliott.computer/">Elliot Cost</a>’s million sites that
seem to constantly change and yet are always compelling, Paloma’s
accessible artist portfolio, and the miles of pages of Cory
Arcangel.</p>
<p>I started out by exploring <a href="https://palomakop.tv/">Paloma
Kop’s site</a> because it’s a clear and compelling design, keeping
principles of low-bandwidth/consumption. It’s also a well-organized
artist’s portfolio site. Paloma’s site is CC BY SA and they generously
wrote a clear <a href="https://palomakop.tv/website-info/">website info
page</a> which has lots of information on the design, going into things
like lazy-loading images, minimizing js, using system fonts. Seems like
a great way to get started. In fact, it’s how I’m getting this site
started!</p>
<p>One problem I have is that I crank out a ton of projects. I have
hundreds. You wouldn’t know that from the current website portfolio
page, and some are tiny projects and others are big. So I’ve also
studied <a href="https://coryarcangel.com/">Cory Arcangel’s site</a>,
who is the Merzbow of joke gallery objects. His site is designed to just
list all of his art things, from websites to bots to saleable objects to
each individual slightly different color shade sculpture. Certainly it’s
a minimal site design in some ways, but he uses Jekyll, which I have
many years of experience working with now, and I’m not keen to build my
own portfolio with it. To be honest, this is Cory’s worst incarnation of
his website. It’s no longer fun to browse and his art has grown less
interesting for me lately, but I’ll just keep that to myself.</p>
<p>I also looked at <a href="https://increpare.com/">Increpare’s
site</a> since he cranks out dozens or hundreds of games too, to glean
how that could look. The design is not fancy but it’s fast and quickly
shows what each game looks like and their info pages are
straightforward, though maybe under-informing.</p>
<p>I also looked at some friends’ sites too that use long lists of
projects that link to individual project pages. Not the right approach
for me. I determined that it is important to me to have at least one
image for each project that links to the project page. In contrast,
there are some websites that are text only lists that link to project
pages, but that’s not a fun way (for me) to browse when designing work
meant to be seen.</p>
<p>I spent time perusing cargo.site since they have nice brutalist
templates, but when I actually try those sitesI find many harder to
navigate through or not nearly as expansive as my site needs to be to
capture all my work.</p>
<p>Okay, so I’ve tried some things, looked at code, ran some code. I am
not linking it here but I pretty quickly 1-for-1 re-built my a clone of
Arcangel’s site in about 20 minutes. This is only because I’ve a lot of
experience with Jekyll and his CSS is dead simple.</p>
<p>So if I’m not a fan of the Jekyll static site generator but also find
HTML tedious when I have hundreds of pages then one other aspect of this
is to build my own static site generator. I generally prefer using
pandoc for converting between formats, so I’ll create a wrapper around
that.</p>
<p>And that’s what I’ve done here: I built this very December Adventure
page tonight starting with HTML and CSS from Paloma (thanks!) and then
modifying, and using pandoc with a structured system.</p>
<p>Here’s the foundation of the static site builder, which runs after
save:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#build.sh</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">pandoc</span> <span class="at">-s</span> index.md <span class="at">-o</span> index.html <span class="at">-H</span> assets/includes/header.html <span class="at">-c</span> assets/css/main.css <span class="at">--metadata</span> title=<span class="st">&quot;December Adventure&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result of all that is this page you’re looking at now.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: gallery view page experiments</p>
<h2 id="dec-2">Dec 2</h2>
<p>End of day 1 looked like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/img/1.jpg" alt="Day 1 text page" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Day 1 text page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Images are converted and compressed with imagemagick:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">convert</span> source.png <span class="at">-resize</span> 400x <span class="at">-quality</span> 85% output.jpg</span></code></pre></div>
<p>My partner has more experience as a professional web dev, looked at
my day 1 writeup and was basically like “yeah i’m not reading that” but
then gave me some good design and css feedback.</p>
<p>I took that into account, then showed them an old experiment page I
did with an overlay. She suggested I try it using css background with a
container. Because I’m trying to use out of the box semantic web
classless CSS I got into a roadblock where I wanted the speckled digital
dirt as an overlay for the whole page whilst also having the gradient
background. At first this appeared impossible, with whichever is latter
replacing the earlier one (due to ‘cascading’) but after some searching
I came across a solution to place them in the same css line and it
worked. Then I added some background blur to the body to try to make the
text more readable, and played around a bit to balance trying to soften
the hard edge of the bounding body box versus readability. I’ll try to
get some feedback later on whether this is as compelling design, and to
test the readability/accessibility.</p>
<p>Here’s the current page design:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/img/2.jpg"
alt="Day 2 text page with new gravel overlay" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Day 2 text page with new gravel
overlay</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="dec-3">Dec 3</h2>
<p>Beginning of day 3, here is the site currently. I didn’t quite get to
the gallery pages yet, but will try today.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/img/3.jpg"
alt="Day 3 text page, looking hopefully complete" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Day 3 text page, looking hopefully
complete</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I tracked down some tricky bugs today and no one but me will know but
I’m writing it out anyway: basically, although my body background image
speckles were blurred below the centered body section with text on
desktop cross-browser, I found that the background wasn’t blurred on iOS
Firefox or Safari browsers that I tested. I couldn’t quite find the
answer online, but I noticed that the backdrop-filter css selector was
relatively new and re-read the caniuse.com page for it several times.
There’s no firefox iOS column there and I remembered that firefox on iOS
is actually webkit. iOS Safari requires a trick to figure out its
version - it’s based on what iOS system software you’re running, and
since mine is a version or two behind, it turns out my version of
safari/webkit needs the –webkit prefix I believe. Also, I saw that
images seemed to be loading on top of the speckled background image, but
text wasn’t, so as another potential fix I added a clear background by
adding a background-color of rgba(255,255,255,0.1). In other words,
white with a mostly transparent background. After deploying, one or both
of these fixes seems to have fixed it! Tested on iOS on ipad and iphone
now. All is well.</p>
<p>I also did some <a
href="https://www.accessibilitychecke.org">accessibility checking</a> to
make sure the overlaid but blurred body speckles don’t make it hard to
read the text. It seemed to pass the test except for my codeblocks. When
I look at the markdown-&gt;html rendered output, they seem to have added
classes and spans. I’ll come back to examine those again later and see
why that’s happening. It may be in the pandoc converter.</p>
<p>Okay, so now that I’m happy with this text page, I finally turned to
working on the project gallery page.</p>
<p>I again began by looking at Paloma’s gallery page. In particular, I
think the choice to use CSS is a smart one. I began by modifying and
removing classes to try to get this closer to a classless CSS. I’m doing
this to try to simplify. I also played with widths, margins, colors,
removing borders, and sizing. I think it was a nice foundation and I
will ultimately likely make a number of changes here. Nothing to show
yet, the work continues…</p>
<p>I also thought I’d do an experiment to see if my text page would work
as the homepage/landing page.</p>
<p>I added just a few lines of css to override a few defaults trying to
give a bit more oomph.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode css"><code class="sourceCode css"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">/* assets/css/home.css */</span></span>

<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  backdrop-filter:<span class="fu">blur(</span><span class="dv">3</span><span class="dt">px</span><span class="fu">)</span><span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/img/4.jpg"
alt="A test image of my current ‘homepage’ text using mostly the same css as a text page" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A test image of my current ‘homepage’
text using mostly the same css as a text page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To be honest, I don’t think it feels like it ‘works.’ While I like
having a quick bio/statement up front, I think this isn’t a strong
landing page and will need to go back and look at some good landing page
examples from other artists.</p>
<h2 id="dec-4">Dec 4</h2>
<p>I didn’t have as much time to work on this today since I was helping
my partner prep for a job interview earlier today and then had to go to
school to teach my Monday night Programming for Visual Artists class. It
was the final session before final projects and presentations are due. I
helped a number of students, brought pizza for everyone, but I continued
to work with students after the normal session ended and so I missed my
bus and train. I live really far from school and the school shuttle and
the train are not timed correctly anymore and so this meant I had to
wait 45 minutes for the Metro North train. All this waiting meant I got
home at midnight instead of 10:30pm, sheesh. This happens, it’s okay. I
had a good magazine to read and my computer. Next semester I’m teaching
a more normal schedule. As part of students’ final projects they need to
do writing, screenshots, and talk about their project development, very
much like how folks are writing about their ongoing work for
DecemberAdventure, so I pointed out a few of the logs and had students
check them out.</p>
<p>On the train home I worked on the gallery page a bit, and did a
little bit more before bed. I think it’s coming along, but still more
work to be done.</p>
