<h1 class="title">December Adventure</h1>
</header>
<p>, though I’ll want to also have the project description there, before
any links## Dec 1</p>
<p>Okay, I’m starting the <a
href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">December Adventure</a> but
worried my first project is too much slog and not enough adventure. I
need to rebuild my website! So this means I’ll need to make it more fun
for myself: an actual adventure.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to get the motivation to rebuild it many times previously.
It mostly looked like the same homepage for the past 6 years. Then a
couple months ago I changed my landing page to a HTML only page with
dithered image. Nerdy, yes, but is this actually a good landing page for
an artist? Anyway, the whole site is a hodgepodge now, and all of my
projects that I crank out are not in the portfolio or linked from the
gallery page. This needs must change!</p>
<p>Starting out, here are my goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t reinvent the wheel. If someone has built better, and is
sharing their code, then it’s fine to re-use and share as well</li>
<li>yes, brutalist, but readable</li>
<li>do your best to keep semantic HTML and accessibility ideas in
mind</li>
<li>can you make things lower bandwidth?</li>
<li>make things flexible and fun so the site can grow and adapt to my
idiosyncratic and changing projects and ways of working and grow over
time</li>
<li>Capture the spirit of my previous work with my webpage, e.g. <a
href="https://leetusman.com/studio-visit/">Studio visit</a>, <a
href="https://leetusman.com/404">404</a>, <a
href="https://leetusman.com/everyday">everyday</a> etc</li>
</ul>
<p>My three spirit websites for this are <a
href="https://elliott.computer/">Elliot Cost</a>’s million sites that
seem to constantly change and yet are always compelling, Paloma’s
accessible artist portfolio, and the miles of pages of Cory
Arcangel.</p>
<p>I started out by exploring <a href="https://palomakop.tv/">Paloma
Kop’s site</a> because it’s a clear and compelling design, keeping
principles of low-bandwidth/consumption. It’s also a well-organized
artist’s portfolio site. Paloma’s site is CC BY SA and they generously
wrote a clear <a href="https://palomakop.tv/website-info/">website info
page</a> which has lots of information on the design, going into things
like lazy-loading images, minimizing js, using system fonts. Seems like
a great way to get started. In fact, it’s how I’m getting this site
started!</p>
<p>One problem I have is that I crank out a ton of projects. I have
hundreds. You wouldn’t know that from the current website portfolio
page, and some are tiny projects and others are big. So I’ve also
studied <a href="https://coryarcangel.com/">Cory Arcangel’s site</a>,
who is the Merzbow of joke gallery objects. His site is designed to just
list all of his art things, from websites to bots to saleable objects to
each individual slightly different color shade sculpture. Certainly it’s
a minimal site design in some ways, but he uses Jekyll, which I have
many years of experience working with now, and I’m not keen to build my
own portfolio with it. To be honest, this is Cory’s worst incarnation of
his website. It’s no longer fun to browse and his art has grown less
interesting for me lately, but I’ll just keep that to myself.</p>
<p>I also looked at <a href="https://increpare.com/">Increpare’s
site</a> since he cranks out dozens or hundreds of games too, to glean
how that could look. The design is not fancy but it’s fast and quickly
shows what each game looks like and their info pages are
straightforward, though maybe under-informing.</p>
<p>I also looked at some friends’ sites too that use long lists of
projects that link to individual project pages. Not the right approach
for me. I determined that it is important to me to have at least one
image for each project that links to the project page. In contrast,
there are some websites that are text only lists that link to project
pages, but that’s not a fun way (for me) to browse when designing work
meant to be seen.</p>
<p>I spent time perusing cargo.site since they have nice brutalist
templates, but when I actually try those sitesI find many harder to
navigate through or not nearly as expansive as my site needs to be to
capture all my work.</p>
<p>Okay, so I’ve tried some things, looked at code, ran some code. I am
not linking it here but I pretty quickly 1-for-1 re-built my a clone of
Arcangel’s site in about 20 minutes. This is only because I’ve a lot of
experience with Jekyll and his CSS is dead simple.</p>
<p>So if I’m not a fan of the Jekyll static site generator but also find
HTML tedious when I have hundreds of pages then one other aspect of this
is to build my own static site generator. I generally prefer using
pandoc for converting between formats, so I’ll create a wrapper around
that.</p>
<p>And that’s what I’ve done here: I built this very December Adventure
page tonight starting with HTML and CSS from Paloma (thanks!) and then
modifying, and using pandoc with a structured system.</p>
<p>Here’s the foundation of the static site builder, which runs after
save:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#build.sh</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">pandoc</span> <span class="at">-s</span> index.md <span class="at">-o</span> index.html <span class="at">-H</span> assets/includes/header.html <span class="at">-c</span> assets/css/main.css <span class="at">--metadata</span> title=<span class="st">&quot;December Adventure&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result of all that is this page you’re looking at now.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: gallery view page experiments</p>
<h2 id="dec-2">Dec 2</h2>
<p>End of day 1 looked like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/img/1.jpg" alt="Day 1 text page" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Day 1 text page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Images are converted and compressed with imagemagick:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">convert</span> source.png <span class="at">-resize</span> 400x <span class="at">-quality</span> 85% output.jpg</span></code></pre></div>
<p>My partner has more experience as a professional web dev, looked at
my day 1 writeup and was basically like “yeah i’m not reading that” but
then gave me some good design and css feedback.</p>
<p>I took that into account, then showed them an old experiment page I
did with an overlay. She suggested I try it using css background with a
container. Because I’m trying to use out of the box semantic web
classless CSS I got into a roadblock where I wanted the speckled digital
dirt as an overlay for the whole page whilst also having the gradient
background. At first this appeared impossible, with whichever is latter
replacing the earlier one (due to ‘cascading’) but after some searching
I came across a solution to place them in the same css line and it
worked. Then I added some background blur to the body to try to make the
text more readable, and played around a bit to balance trying to soften
the hard edge of the bounding body box versus readability. I’ll try to
get some feedback later on whether this is as compelling design, and to
test the readability/accessibility.</p>
<p>Here’s the current page design:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/img/2.jpg"
alt="Day 2 text page with new gravel overlay" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Day 2 text page with new gravel
overlay</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="dec-3">Dec 3</h2>
<p>Beginning of day 3, here is the site currently. I didn’t quite get to
the gallery pages yet, but will try today.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/img/3.jpg"
alt="Day 3 text page, looking hopefully complete" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Day 3 text page, looking hopefully
complete</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I tracked down some tricky bugs today and no one but me will know but
I’m writing it out anyway: basically, although my body background image
speckles were blurred below the centered body section with text on
desktop cross-browser, I found that the background wasn’t blurred on iOS
Firefox or Safari browsers that I tested. I couldn’t quite find the
answer online, but I noticed that the backdrop-filter css selector was
relatively new and re-read the caniuse.com page for it several times.
There’s no firefox iOS column there and I remembered that firefox on iOS
is actually webkit. iOS Safari requires a trick to figure out its
version - it’s based on what iOS system software you’re running, and
since mine is a version or two behind, it turns out my version of
safari/webkit needs the –webkit prefix I believe. Also, I saw that
images seemed to be loading on top of the speckled background image, but
text wasn’t, so as another potential fix I added a clear background by
adding a background-color of rgba(255,255,255,0.1). In other words,
white with a mostly transparent background. After deploying, one or both
of these fixes seems to have fixed it! Tested on iOS on ipad and iphone
now. All is well.</p>
<p>I also did some <a
href="https://www.accessibilitychecke.org">accessibility checking</a> to
make sure the overlaid but blurred body speckles don’t make it hard to
read the text. It seemed to pass the test except for my codeblocks. When
I look at the markdown-&gt;html rendered output, they seem to have added
classes and spans. I’ll come back to examine those again later and see
why that’s happening. It may be in the pandoc converter.</p>
<p>Okay, so now that I’m happy with this text page, I finally turned to
working on the project gallery page.</p>
<p>I again began by looking at Paloma’s gallery page. In particular, I
think the choice to use CSS is a smart one. I began by modifying and
removing classes to try to get this closer to a classless CSS. I’m doing
this to try to simplify. I also played with widths, margins, colors,
removing borders, and sizing. I think it was a nice foundation and I
will ultimately likely make a number of changes here. Nothing to show
yet, the work continues…</p>
<p>I also thought I’d do an experiment to see if my text page would work
as the homepage/landing page.</p>
<p>I added just a few lines of css to override a few defaults trying to
give a bit more oomph.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A test image of my current ‘homepage’

<p>To be honest, I don’t think it feels like it ‘works.’ While I like
having a quick bio/statement up front, I think this isn’t a strong
landing page and will need to go back and look at some good landing page
examples from other artists.</p>
<h2 id="dec-4">Dec 4</h2>
<p>I didn’t have as much time to work on this today since I was helping
my partner prep for a job interview earlier today and then had to go to
school to teach my Monday night Programming for Visual Artists class. It
was the final session before final projects and presentations are due. I
helped a number of students, brought pizza for everyone, but I continued
to work with students after the normal session ended and so I missed my
bus and train. I live really far from school and the school shuttle and
the train are not timed correctly anymore and so this meant I had to
wait 45 minutes for the Metro North train. All this waiting meant I got
home at midnight instead of 10:30pm, sheesh. This happens, it’s okay. I
had a good magazine to read and my computer. Next semester I’m teaching
a more normal schedule. As part of students’ final projects they need to
do writing, screenshots, and talk about their project development, very
much like how folks are writing about their ongoing work for
DecemberAdventure, so I pointed out a few of the logs and had students
check them out.</p>
<p>On the train home I worked on the gallery page a bit, and did a
little bit more before bed. I think it’s coming along, but still more
work to be done.</p>
<p><em>Page last updated: 2023-12-04</em></p>
<h2 id="dec-5">Dec 5</h2>
<p>Was busy on other projects today that didn’t involve code.</p>
<h2 id="dec-6">Dec 6</h2>
<p>On the train ride home from teaching I did some more tests on the
projects page. One question I had was whether I could replicate the
gallery container individual items using semantic html rather than
individual added classes. It seems like this approach should work, and I
started modifying the css.</p>
<p>After a good bit of wrangling I was successful. What this means is
that one should be able to write the gallery landing page in straight
markdown. So for example:</p>
<pre><code>![Project 1 name](assets/img/projects/project1/1.jpg)</code></pre>
<p>turns into:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/projects/project1/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Project 1 name&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Project 1 name&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And because of how I edited the CSS page this gets automatically
placed into the CSS grid. I need to modify the CSS some more to get it
chunkier in a way that I like. Here is the first working version, though
not yet styled the way I want it, but it is a proof of concept and shows
that markdown alone can produce the gallery page:</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/img/6.jpg" alt="Projects gallery page v1" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Projects gallery page v1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After a pause I realized a fatal flaw. While this does render a nice
gallery page, it doesn’t automatically work well with linking each image
to its own individual project page associated with the image.</p>
<p>For example, to do this in pure markdown would be written thus:</p>
<pre><code>[![Test project](assets/img/testproject1.jpg)](projects/testproject/index.html)</code></pre>
<p>Oof, that’s ugly code. And it no longer will produce the accessible
figure/figcaption rendered output, and due to the ugly syntax may
possible cause mistakes later if I mess up a bracket or parentheses.</p>
<p>I had to rethink my strategy. My options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>write this ugly markdown and just accept it</li>
<li>switch back to html :(</li>
<li>write a combo of markdown and html (not a better solution)</li>
<li>potentially write a pandoc lua extension that gives me another
option? This last one will require some research to see if it’s
possible.</li>
<li>I found an <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61071158/add-image-with-link-in-githubs-readme-md">alternative
idea</a> on Stack Overflow, with a new syntax, see below, though it
doesn’t automatically render the alt text to a caption.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[&lt;img alt=&quot;Project 1&quot; src=&quot;path/to/image.png&quot;&gt;](https://link-to-your-URL/)</code></pre>
<p>I’m currently leaning toward this one but need to do more tests and
research. I’m wondering if I can write a lua extension so that I get my
preferred figure and figcaption output. I’ll have to look into this.</p>
<h2 id="dec-7">Dec 7</h2>
<p>I didn’t have a ton of time today but I spent an hour exploring
writing lua extensions as tests for pandoc but I didn’t get anything
particularly useable yet. At this point I’m thinking I’ll likely go back
to pure HTML for the gallery! :0</p>
<h2 id="dec-8">Dec 8</h2>
<p>More gallery rendering work.</p>
<p>I read up about <a
href="https://pandoc.org/chunkedhtml-demo/8.17-images.html">image</a>
options in pandoc markdown, and decided that this markdown solution to
producing a gallery of images (with links) with captions would be too
monstrous:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">[</span><span class="al">![Lost Angeles](../assets/img/projects/lost/lost1.png)</span><span class="co">](./projects/lost-angeles)</span>{.gallery-item}  </span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Lost Angeles**  </span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Livestreamed Performance  </span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>2016  </span></code></pre></div>
<p>I don’t think that’s really any better than this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">&lt;div</span> <span class="er">class</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;gallery-item&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></span>

<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">&lt;img</span> <span class="er">src</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;../assets/img/projects/lost/lost1.png&quot;</span> <span class="er">alt</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;Lost Angeles&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>Lost Angeles<span class="kw">&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">&lt;p&gt;</span>Livestreamed Performance<span class="kw">&lt;/p&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">&lt;p&gt;</span>2016<span class="kw">&lt;/p&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="kw">&lt;/a&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The latter is also easier to debug and has less chance of making a
syntax error.</p>

<p>I can’t believe how many hours it took me to explore and then
eventually settle back pretty much where I started. Anyway, next step
will be to actually clean up images, move them into directories, and
then build this page. Still a bit more CSS cleanup as well.</p>

<p>When you get bogged down, pivot. At least that’s what I tried. I
didn’t feel like working on organizing my project image directories yet
or building a template project page, and was still bummed by my gallery
markdown generator turning up lemons. So I decided to work on the
landing page. On a whim, on the train to school on the way to my last
Programming for Visual Artists class I started trying something out,
then continued in my office before class, and then again on the train
home again tonight. And I’m pretty happy with what I’ve done though I’ve
yet to get outside feedback, and it’s possible I may feel differently
later. So caveat emptor: this could all change tomorrow.</p>

<p>What I like about it: it’s both chunky and readable. It feels like a
cross between my competing aesthetic and project goals. Text-oriented,
but still supporting images. And a nice ‘timeless’ design (whatever that
means). It doesn’t look totally out of place from my programmer-y
friends sites, but also isn’t totally 180 degrees from an artist site.
Though perhaps too much text up front?</p>
<p>Next I worked on the file size issue. The background jpeg was pretty
big, 422k. Yikes. My goal is to try to make the image look as hi res as
possible while as low file size as possible. I know that’s a squishy
goal. Should I start with the lowest resolution and use a media query to
switch out images and serve a higher resolution file on bigger screens
or with certain browser indicators? I’m not certain.</p>
<p>First I reached for the imagemagick ‘swiss army knife’ tool, one of
my beloved software tools. I ran some imagemagick conversion tests to
try things out trying to chase the goal of highest quality resolution
while minimizing image size.</p>
<p>I tried a number of ways to limit file size. I took a somewhat staged
photo of my messy desk in my office at school, then converted to jpeg
and limited the image to 1920x1280. The image was 422k. I read a <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7261855/recommendation-for-compressing-jpg-files-with-imagemagick">stackoverflow
answer</a> and a short <a
href="https://dev.to/feldroy/til-strategies-for-compressing-jpg-files-with-imagemagick-5fn9">article</a>
with several techniques that I tried out: “lighthouse” image
compression, gaussian blur, and a mix of the two. I didn’t think the
lighthouse approach looked good, and neither did the mixture one. The
gaussian blur looked best to me and was compressed almost as much.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#convert with gaussian blur and 50% quality</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">convert</span> desk.jpg <span class="at">-strip</span> <span class="at">-interlace</span> Plane <span class="at">-gaussian-blur</span> 0.05 <span class="at">-quality</span> 50% desk-gaussian.jpg</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then I tried out a different imagemagick technique, the “define”
parameter. To be honest, I’m not sure what this algorithm is, but I had
success with it as well, and it’s a more straightforward command.
Essentially, you list what filesize you’re targeting. When I specified
200k I got an image I could accept. When I tried 100k it was too low
resolution. 150k was the minimum I found to be tolerable.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#convert using defined max file size</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">convert</span> desk.jpg <span class="at">-define</span> jpeg:extent=150kb desk-limit-150k.jpg</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The compression technique was different between these the gaussian
blur and the defined filesize approach but it was a toss-up which one
was better.</p>

<p>Okay, I think I’m at a good stopping point tonight. I’ll go back to
working on the gallery pages next I think.</p>
<h2 id="dec-12">Dec 12</h2>
<p>Lots of non-computer activity today. I went on several hours worth of
bike riding today on the road, in the park and on the trail, despite the
cold. Tonight I saw a noise show at Trans-Pecos in Bushwick. It was a
pretty great performance by The Daxophone Consort.</p>
<p>I got home and first did some research on opengraph tags, which I’ll
only call OG tags going forward. I am vaguely aware of these but never
looked into them before. It only took a couple minutes to track down the
info thankfully. These are used for the “cards” that pop up on social
media, which I knew, but nothing else. There are 4 that should always be
used, though 2 basically copy the title and url. The other 2 are type,
of which it’s either “article” for writing/blog, or “website” for
everything else, and og:image for a thumbnail. Did I mention these were
invented by Facebook, for this nonsense? Nonetheless I think I may add
them. So the 4 to include: og:title, og:url, og:image, og:type. It’s a
good idea to also include og: description. og:description should be 2-4
sentences, and can just copy the meta description, which I should also
add. The og:image is the most important because this is the image that
will pop up on social media feeds. The og:title should be the “raw
title” without the site name. If I go the route of creating frontmatter
I can probably include some of these in the frontmatter if needed and
have them auto-populate in the header.</p>
<p>Back to working on the gallery page. I took a different tact and
decided to browse gallery pages that looked good to me. First I visited
<a href="https://cargo.site/">Cargo</a> and viewed their Sites in Use
page, then selected a few I liked. They create templates for artists and
designers. I’ve used their sites for inspiration before when creating my
own websites. Their images load slowly and I find myself closing the
page before they are done rendering. Their text is often hard to read or
most of the time, absent. Their lightboxes are often crummy. So there’s
a lot to like in layout but the details often dissapoint.</p>
<p>Here’s some sites I liked: This very simple <a
href="https://monicabusquets.com/">2up</a> gallery page, though the
individual pages are slow and hard to read; this <a
href="https://dccw.info/">single column gallery</a> looks good and I
like the interstitial text descriptors between, though there are no
individual artwork pages; this <a
href="https://raphaelwicki.com/Archive-1">random placement portfolio</a>
I thought was simple and looked nice and bold with background black and
individual project pages were clear enough but needed a lot of
scrolling.</p>
<p>Based on this, I decided to temporarily abandon my work on the
gallery page I had done previously, and now I did some basic flexbox
layouts. Here’s a super simple one, no gaps, 2 columns.</p>

<p>Will try more on the train tomorrow during my last day of class for
the semester.</p>
<h2 id="dec-13">Dec 13</h2>
<p>Woke up early to get to school for a meeting. It’s the last day of
the semester in-person for me. I picked up donuts for the students
enroute. I coded a bit on the train and almost overlooked getting out at
the right stop. Later I had a short break between a meeting and class so
I dropped off some pies to the admin assistants as a holiday treat, got
myself lunch, and then worked a bit on the site. After class I took the
train home, worked a little on the gallery page. In the late evening I
tried many things out. I added the nav bar correctly to the gallery
page, then merged my dev branch with my main. I tried applying my
decemberadventure stylesheet to the now page and resources, but after
checking them out, I didn’t think they were compelling. I tried
replicating what I had done on my new homepage prototype and found I
liked that look a lot more.</p>
<p>Here’s the now page, albeit with some bugs. I need to add some
background color to the nav.</p>

<p>Here’s a bookmark to a <a href="https://valentine-thebaut.fr/">2up
gallery page</a> made with Cargo. I want to revisit this later when
working on individual project pages, though the nav is bad and pages
lack text descriptions and links. This is the <a
href="https://raphaelwicki.com/Archive-1">other gallery page</a> I built
in flexbox before the current simpler design, but I think its nav at the
top is simpler and maybe better fits my page design than the one I have
currently.</p>
<h2 id="dec-14">Dec 14</h2>
<p>Worked on school things today. In the evening, Laura’s flower shop
had an opening party that we went to.</p>
<h2 id="dec-15">Dec 15</h2>
<p>Editor meetings and school work day.</p>
<h2 id="dec-16">Dec 16</h2>
<p>Grading, cooking, then performance and solstice party night.</p>
<h2 id="dec-17">Dec 17</h2>
<p>Worked a little bit on the site tonight. Started working on an
individual project page template and tried a few different layout and
modifications in CSS, mostly using a column approach. In some tests I
tried running images full-width and in others I had a centered column.
I’ll spend more time on this in the coming days.</p>
<h2 id="dec-18-and-19">Dec 18 and 19</h2>
<p>End of semester grading work and hanging out with my partner,
watching a movie, but no coding work.</p>
<h2 id="dec-20">Dec 20</h2>
<p>Worked on the now page a bit to clean up the design.</p>

<p>I did some work on the resources page as well. I tried finding a good
background image, but I think I could still choose better. In any case,
here’s my placeholder for now. I’m also uncertain if “resources” is the
right term for the page. Should it be a “wiki” or something else? I know
I want to link to my workshops, classes, tutorials, podcast, things like
that. I guess some of those are also “projects” but I’m thinking of
“Projects” as holding my art projects and this “Resources” page as my
teaching and organizing. Will think more on this, but for now,
“Resources” works.</p>
<figure>

alt="Resources page with placeholder background img" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Resources page with placeholder

<p>Hmm, I think the Resources background text blocks look better than
the Now page groupings. It’s a bit much to have those separations
between the individual paragraphs.</p>
<p>Okay, after some crazy css wrangling (and help from my partner),
here’s a version of the Now page with the paragraphs grouped together. I
think it looks a bit better.</p>

<p>This is still “classless” but I’m using some bizarre css-selector
combos so I’m not sure it’s worth not using classes/id’s for this!</p>
<p>This seems like a kludgy solution, but on second thought, there is a
certain charm if not elegance:</p>

<p>Well, it works.</p>
<p>I realize I have been putting off the inevitable organizing task of
grabbing photos, placing them in directories, and making individual
project pages. If any part of site-building demanded automation, that
would be it. I hope I can pivot to this soon. I want to finish up the
site design this week and deploy by the end of the month.</p>
<p>A short while later, trying a new background image out for the
resources page. I think this looks better.</p>

<h2 id="dec-24">Dec 24</h2>
<p>A few days off. Tonight I did a <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/social-software">backup of
custom functions</a> from the <a
href="https://leetusman.com/nosebook/computer-systems-social-networks">tilde
server</a> I created for the Social Software class. This isn’t a backup
of the whole server or its software - it’s more like the students’
custom functions, my intro, and then our created command line
<em>thumb</em> program (a function) that is like a wrapper around
<em>finger</em> that creates a tiny little social media on our server. I
retired the server so I don’t have to pay a monthly fee out of pocket
after the course ends.</p>
<h2 id="dec-25">Dec 25</h2>
<p>Worked on some styling cleanup on a few pages of my website design.
After a few days away I still feel pretty solid on the design and just
need to dedicate a few hours to building the gallery pages now, but I’m
not sure when that time will come since it’s a busy “vacation” this
week. I’d really like to be done by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Looked at my old photocopyfier program. I’d like to port this to
love2d with a gui I think.</p>
<p>Spent some time with Runna. I think the game is compelling, it just
needs final graphics/theming. I’m wondering if it makes sense to partner
with someone else, or purchase/find assets, or try to draw them
myself.</p>
<p>Started building out some frontmatter system for the individual
project pages.</p>
<h2 id="dec-30">Dec 30</h2>
<p>My parents visited for a few days and I did some work on the site but
haven’t finished yet. Will have to keep going into January.</p>
<p>Spent time the past week or two finishing the Programming in Lua
book, and am now onto another Lua book for bedtime reading. I also
checked out winduptoy’s Lichen ssg, and review some forth / html gui
ideas.</p>
<p>On my webiste project I’ve done some more tweaking and playing.
Tonight I revisited my gallery page yet again. Maybe simple is best. I
spent time looking at <a href="https://arambartholl.com/archive/">Aram’s
website Works archive</a> and <a
href="https://increpare.com">Increpare’s</a> and while I can’t quite
match their output, I do pump out work pretty consistently. They both
use a simple grid layout, with title, medium, year, thumbnail - and I
think I should try that. Aram’s I thought was an even grid but it’s more
a coincidence that he chooses the same size image. Increpare’s is a
consistent grid.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/img/30.jpg" alt="Simple grid gallery page" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Simple grid gallery page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I still need to work on this a bit, and it’s uber-basic, but I think
it will serve my purpose of allowing for displaying lots of work. I got
down a first version of the responsive view but it’s not dialed down
yet. Images are stretching funny.</p>
<p>Adding the year (or year and month) is important, to show that the
page is dynamic with new projects. Adding the “medium” I think is
informative here as well. So here’s each label:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre
class="sourceCode txt"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Title (in bold)</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>medium</span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>year</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I re-visited <a href="https://elliott.computer/">Elliott’s
website</a> and he’s again changed it up completely. This is the second
site redesign in a month or so. I admire his experimentation though I
don’t think I can expect my guests to come back as often or to be as
jazzed at these kinds of big changes. But still, how can I maintain some
of his experimentation and flexibility to add new things on the landing?
Maybe drop-in hand-authored html? Images wrapped in links? Will keep in
mind some ideas.</p>
<p>Next step is to improve some of the responsive Css for the gallery
page, then work on more on the design for the individual project page.
Aram’s <a href="https://arambartholl.com/this-is-fine/">project page</a>
template is again a good model I think, though I’ll want to also have
the project description there, before any links.</p>
<p>I’m not quite in the home stretch but I’m getting there. I’m feeling
like all the parts are pretty much in place. I just need to finish the
project page, clean up CSS differences between pages and in the nav, and
then complete a consistent, replicable workflow for updating pages.</p>
